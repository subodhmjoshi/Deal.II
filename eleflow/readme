WHAT:

This python code helps in visualization of elementary flows i.e. inviscid, incompressible and 
irrotational fluid flow.
The user can place several elementary flows in a square domain [0,1] X [0,1]. 
Following elementary structures are supported:
1. sources and sinks
2. uniform flow
3. Doublet 
4. Vortex 

More complex flow patterns can be generated through superposition of several elementary flows.
e.g. a source and a sink can be placed very close to one onother to simulate a doublet. 
Similarly, two sources can be used to simulate wall effects etc.

WHY:

This code was written as a tool to visualize elementary flows. Elementary flows are simple to 
manipulate, yet present a very powerful toolbox for understanding the flow physics. Elementary
flow structures are used to derive many important theories in aerodynamics. 
This code gives user an ability to play with the elementary flow structures.
