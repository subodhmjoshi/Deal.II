This is a simple 2D unstructed Euler solver. To run:
$python Run.py

More complex problems can be constructed by changing .poly file.
Refer Triangle software documentation for the details. 

The Neighbors are found based on Voronoi diagram (also provided by Triangle)

Refer grid.py for implementation.

The code is currently poorly documented as of now. To be sorted out.
